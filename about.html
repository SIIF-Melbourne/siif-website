                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <h3>Born out of Purpose. Built on Impact.</h3>
                    <p>In a world where finance often feels detached from social good, the Social Impact Investment Fund (SIIF) emerged with a different vision — one where numbers tell a story not just of returns, but of responsibility.</p>
                    
                    <p>Founded by students at the University of Melbourne, SIIF began as the first and only student-led investment fund in Victoria managing real capital, with the goal of bridging financial literacy and social impact. From its inception, the club operated with a bold commitment: 100% of capital gains and dividends from our $20,000 fund would be donated to socially impactful organisations — a promise we continue to uphold today.</p>
                    
                    <p>What started as a niche idea among a handful of finance enthusiasts has grown into a thriving hub for commerce students seeking hands-on experience in equities research, portfolio management, and ethical investing. Alongside this, our members gain access to industry mentorship, practical workshops (like our flagship DCF Modelling series), and events that open doors to careers in finance — all while creating meaningful change in their community.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 2023–2024 alone, SIIF delivered over $1400 in charitable donations, ran events in collaboration with firms and societies across law, consulting, and finance, and grew its membership to over 300 active participants.</p>
