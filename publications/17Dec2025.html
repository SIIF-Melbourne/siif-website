                <h2>Inflation Dynamics</h2>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Inflation remains the central macroeconomic variable shaping the global outlook for 2025–2027, 
                        acting as the anchor for monetary policy decisions, real interest rates, bond yields, and broader 
                        financial conditions. After two years of rapid global disinflation from the post-pandemic peaks, 
                        the global economy has transitioned more slowly and with more uncertainty across major 
                        economies. Inflation has fallen in most regions; however, core inflation, such as in services, 
                        continues to exceed central bank targets in the United States and Australia. These economies 
                        continue to experience elevated wage growth and structural pressures in the housing and 
                        services sectors. Whilst global inflation is being significantly shaped by shifting geopolitics, 
                        volatile energy markets, and gradual productivity gains from emerging technologies. Altogether, 
                        these factors shape the likely path of inflation in the coming years.</p>
                    <h3>Global Inflation</h3>
                        <p>Global Inflation has already eased substantially from its post-pandemic peaks, but most major 
                        institutions expect it to remain above pre-COVID averages in the mid-2020s. Persistent 
                        tightness in labour markets kept core inflation at an elevated level across many economies. In 
                        emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), monthly headline inflation statistics 
                        have been more volatile, and a slight increase in core inflation has been driven largely by rising 
                        services prices and wage pressures.  </p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The global inflation outlook has become more uncertain in 2025 due to various combinations of 
                        shocks, mainly due to substantial tariff increases implemented across major economies. The 
                        tariff hikes have raised the cost of imported consumer goods and production inputs, whilst 
                        shifting demand toward domestic producers that face relatively inelastic short-run supply 
                        conditions. Manufacturers in advanced economies have reported higher input and output prices 
                        as firms adjust to new trade measures. Higher trade barriers, regardless of whether some 
                        economies aren't directly impacted, have led to indirect inflation risks that disrupt global supply 
                        chains and lead to more likely depreciations.  </p>
                        <p>The private sector forecast provides similar conclusions of near-term upward inflation pressures. 
                        J.P. Morgan projects global core inflation to rise to approximately 3.4% in the second half of 
                        2025, due to tariffs.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "First, the transitory boost to the global goods sector in advance of actual and threatened tariff hikes is starting to fade. Downward growth pressure will be reinforced by two factors: a tariff tax hike on US households and businesses, and a decline in global business sentiment related to disruptive US policies,"
                            <cite>Bruce Kasman, chief global economist at J.P. Morgan (J.P. Morgan, 2025)</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>These forces suggest that tariff-related costs and weakening sentiment will slow the pace of global disinflation, even as overall economic activity softens. Outside the United States, core inflation is still expected to moderate, but the global average will remain elevated due to the strong upward contribution from the US economy. This reinforces the broader view that global inflation will decline only gradually and remain above pre-pandemic norms through 2025. </p>
                        <p>Beyond near-term pressures from tariffs and good-sector dynamics, broader structural forces 
                        are shaping medium-term predictions of global inflation. Several institutions have highlighted the 
                        factors of slower global trade, weaker investment and constant shift toward industrial policy. 
                        Global trade volumes have weakened, reducing productivity, limiting the speed of headline and 
                        core inflation returning to target levels. On the other hand, gradual easing of supply-chain 
                        constraints, firms adjusting to shipping costs, and stabilising energy markets create offsetting 
                        downward pressure, particularly for economies less exposed to tariff hikes.  Labour-market 
                        conditions are also expected to slightly loosen if global growth slows, which should ease 
                        services inflation in 2026 and beyond. On a GDP-weighted basis, global inflation is projected to 
                        average about 2.9% in both 2025 and 2026, easing to roughly 2.5% by 2027 (World Bank, 
                        2025). Forecast revisions indicate upward adjustments for advanced economies, primarily 
                        driven by the United States, and downward adjustments for many emerging economies, where 
                        weaker demand for traded goods and lower import costs contribute to faster disinflation 
                        compared to earlier projections (World Bank, 2025).  </p>
                    <h3>US Inflation</h3>
                        <p>In the United States in late 2025, inflation remains elevated compared to pre-pandemic 
                        numbers. Headline consumer price inflation is fluctuating around 3%, while core inflation 
                        remains slightly higher. Several forces contribute to the persistent inflation. Strong domestic 
                        demand continues to support pricing power in many service sectors, especially where supply is 
                        less elastic. Then, labour cost pressures remain prominent, with firms facing wage increases 
                        that are passing the costs to end consumers, especially in healthcare and hospitality sectors. 
                        Most significantly, US inflation pressure comes from tariff pass-through. Effective tariff rates on 
                        imported goods will increase to approximately 15.8% in 2025, as higher-tariff shipments 
                        gradually replace older inventory (J.P. Morgan, 2025). Because importers pay tariffs first and 
                        retailers raise prices only when new goods arrive, much of the impact appears with a several
                        month delay. Under their baseline assumption that roughly half of tariff costs are eventually 
                        passed to consumers, these measures are expected to add around one percentage point to 
                        inflation in Q4 2025, with effects lingering into mid-2026 before fading.  </p>

                        <p>However, several short-run drivers provide temporary offsets. Shelter inflation, which 
                        contributes to 35% of overall CPI, tends to change more slowly than the underlying market. It 
                        continues to ease gradually as new lease rates rise more slowly, and government measures of 
                        rents and owners' equivalent rent are expected to converge with the market trends in the next 
                        18 months, leading shelter inflation to decrease to 3% by December 2026 (J.P. Morgan Asset 
                        Management, 2025). Additionally, Energy prices offer slight relief, contributing 6% to CPI, with a 
                        0.2% year-over-year decline in June.  Futures markets project WTI oil prices to decrease from 
                        $68.40 in July to $61.50 by the end of 2026, due to OPEC increasing production and supply 
                        conditions improving with a potential end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Airline fares are also 
                        currently very low, decreasing 3.5% year-over-year in June, adding further short-term downward 
                        influence (J.P. Morgan Asset Management, 2025)  </p>

                        <p>Looking ahead to 2026, most forecasters expect a gradual but incomplete decline in inflation. 
                        J.P. Morgan projects US CPI at around 3.5 % by Q4 2025, followed by a drift toward 2.8 % by 
                        Q4 2026 (J.P. Morgan Asset Management, 2025). Others identify a short-term inflation increase 
                        in late 2025, followed by slow moderation as wage and rent pressures gradually ease (RBC 
                        Economics, 2025). “Ultimately, consensus projections have headline inflation approaching the 
                        high-2% range, while core inflation lags and may stay above 2% for longer. </p>
                    <h3>Australia Inflation</h3>
                        <p>After a period of moderation, Australia's inflation has returned above the Reserve Bank of 
                        Australia's target band. Headline CPI increased to 3.2% in the September quarter, initially from 
                        2.1% in June, which is the highest rate since mid-2024. RBA uses trimmed-mean inflation, 
                        which is also around 3%, higher than earlier forecasts, as it anticipated a smoother return to the 
                        2-3% band. Consumer inflation expectations remain elevated at around 4.5% (RBA, 2025). </p>

                        </figure>

                        <p>Several domestic factors drive renewed upward pressure. The September quarter data 
                        highlighted price increases spread across various categories, including housing, childcare, 
                        council rates and other administered prices, indicating that firms are passing on higher 
                        operating costs to consumers. Rents and other housing costs have been a key driver, with a 
                        4.7% increase from last year, reflecting the limited rental supply and strong population growth. 
                        Services inflation remains firm, driven by wage growth elevated above pre-pandemic averages 
                        and rising costs in insurance, education and health sectors. The RBA notes that recent readings 
                        point to more underlying inflation pressure than previously expected, and that capacity 
                        constraints in parts of the economy are still present despite softer GDP growth (RBA, 2025).  </p>

                        <p>Despite these pressures, several contributors to inflation are hinting at stabilisation. CPI rent 
                        inflation held at 3.8% year-ended in the September quarter, but the RBA notes that advertised 
                        rents in major capital cities have risen more quickly in recent months, suggesting further rent
                        related inflation will gradually feed into the CPI as leases renew. Construction prices have also 
                        increased by only 1.1%. The RBA also expects the highlights of the September quarter to be 
                        temporary, especially in electricity prices and certain food-related services, where one-off 
                        factors contributed to the quarterly increase.  </p>

                        <p>Looking ahead, the RBA expects inflation to remain above the target forecasts for longer than 
                        anticipated periods, staying above the 2–3% range until mid-2026, before easing gradually 
                        toward the midpoint by early 2027. Headline inflation is forecast to rise to around 3.7% by mid
                        2026 as electricity rebates expire and housing inflation remains firm, before moderating later in 
                        the forecast horizon. The RBA also emphasises that some components, such as food-related 
                        services, travel, and dwelling construction, may experience further volatility. Overall, while 
                        disinflation is progressing more slowly than expected, long-term inflation expectations remain 
                        anchored, and the RBA assesses that easing toward the midpoint target inflation is likely but 
                        may take an extended time.   </p>
                    <h3>Implications</h3>
                        <p>Taken together, inflation in the United States and Australia reflects the broader dynamics 
                        evident across major advanced economies, where inflation is easing but remains above central
                        bank targets due to persistent pressures in the services sector, elevated wage growth, and the 
                        delayed pass-through of cost shocks. While short-term drivers such as improvements in supply 
                        conditions and temporary subsidies offer partial relief, the medium-run projections remain 
                        shaped by domestic demand resilience and sector-specific constraints. As a result, both the 
                        Federal Reserve and the RBA face a slower and more uneven return to target than initially 
                        anticipated, setting the stage for cautious monetary policy adjustments over 2025–2027.  </p>
                <h2>Monetary Policy Outlook</h2>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Monetary policy will remain a strong determinant of global macroeconomic conditions over 2025-2027  as central banks attempt to mitigate persistent core inflation, slowing growth and heightened geopolitical uncertainty. Although inflation has recovered from post-pandemic peaks, disinflation has diminished, particularly in advanced economies where service costs and wage pressures stay elevated. Due to this, financial markets have pushed back expectations for interest-rate cuts in many major economies.  </p>
                    <h3>United States</h3>
                        <p>The Federal Reserve continues to create policies focused on sticky inflation and the labour market, which remains comparatively tight. At its October meeting, the Fed slightly reduced the federal funds rate but maintained a strong emphasis on data dependence and expected inflation to move sustainably toward the 2% objective. </p>
                        <p>The balance sheet and liquidity side of policy remain in focus. In the recent FOMC minutes, the Fed continued its discussion around ending the runoff of its System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio, noting that reserve balances were reaching sufficient levels and continuing the runoff would lead to higher money-market volatility. This indicates that although the policy rate remains the primary tool, the Fed focuses on the policy implementation, particularly in managing reserves and bond markets. </p>
                        <p>The Fed cut its target federal funds interest rate by 0.25%, creating a new target range of 3.75%-4.00%.  Markets have anticipated this decision, but two FOMC members dissented and preferred a 0.50% cut, while another preferred to keep the rates the same. Investors anticipate another cut this year and two next year; however, Jerome Powell, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, warned that a December cut is not at all certain (US Bank). </p>
                        <p>For the Fed to implement rate cuts, it has a few conditions to satisfy. First, there must be a sustained decline in core services inflation, particularly in shelter, healthcare, and hospitality sectors, where wage and cost pressures remain elevated. Then, labour-market indicators must have evident weakening, where job openings, quits rates, and wage growth should converge toward longer-run sustainable levels. Last, consumers and firms must continue to believe that future inflation will stay close to the central bank's target, usually 2%. The Fed's own staff forecast notes that tariff increases pose upward risks to inflation in 2025–26 and that uncertainty remains elevated. </p>
                        <p>Interest rate markets have adjusted their outlook for the end-2026 policy rate, lowering expectations from 3.25% to around 2.9% driven by the revised hiring data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics. Powell warned of additional rate cuts, noting that inflation is still above the 2% objective regardless of the softer labour-market data.  Forecasters have adjusted their expectations accordingly. Although the October cut was expected, Investors now expect easing in mid-2026 with interest rates staying elevated for a longer period. Goldman Sachs Research notes that the recent softening in the US job market is “genuine” and does not expect a significant reversal at the December meeting for the FOMC to cease cutting. They believe a December cut is likely and project another two additional 25 basis point cuts in March and June 2026, ultimately bringing the policy rate to a terminal range of 3.0%-3.25% (Goldman Sachs Research, 2025)  </p>
                        <p>Significant risks remain on both sides of the outlook. Further rounds of tariff hikes, rising energy costs or stronger wage pressures could delay rate cuts, while a further weakening in employment or tighter credit conditions could accelerate the need for cuts. Taken together, the US is likely to face a prolonged disinflation phase and a postponed easing cycle relative to other advanced economies. </p>
                    <h3>Australia</h3>
                        <p>The RBA is entering the 2025-2027 policy cycle cautiously with uncertainty in the economic outlook. While the Bank acknowledges inflation has eased from post-pandemic highs, it has highlighted that its priority is to guide the disinflation process on a credible and sustainable trajectory rather than depending on temporary base effects. As a result, the cash rate has been held at 3.6% with the Board hinting that cutting rates isn't the most optimal move.  </p>
                        <p>Central banks view this policy as slightly restrictive but may need to hold this rate longer. Based on the minutes of the November meeting, the Board concluded that strong housing credit and consumer demand could lead to further restraints instead of earlier easing. Suggesting that Australia's next possible policy could be a pause or a possible tightening rather than a cut. (Reuters, 2025). </p>
                        <p>Market economists expect there will be no cuts through the year. HSBC's Paul Bloxham expects the RBA to keep the cash rate steady through 2025 and 2026, with any potential rate rises in 2027. The current cash rate of 3.6% is effectively as low as mortgage rates can go due to competition among lenders, and cheap funding abroad has compressed mortgage spreads. Meaning that today's cash rate delivers mortgage costs similar to the 2.95% cash rate prior to the pandemic (ABC News, 2025). However, these low spreads are unlikely to persist as banks see higher margins or global funding conditions normalise, mortgage rates could rise regardless of RBA hikes. Ultimately, further rate cuts are unlikely. </p>
                        <p>Although inflation has moderated from its peak, Australia's economy is in a sensitive position, and the RBA faces a narrower margin for error. Small deviations in incoming data, either a renewed lift in demand or a sharper slowdown in household activity, could shift the policy outlook quickly, leaving the Board with limited space to adjust settings without risking either a re-acceleration of inflation or an unnecessary weakening in growth. </p>
                    <h3>Other Markets</h3>
                        <p>Since early 2025, Chinese policymakers have implemented a more proactive macroeconomic stance aimed at supporting growth as the economy faces slower global momentum and rising external risks. In the first half of the year, GDP expanded by 5.3% year-on-year and monetary authorities adopted a policy mix to reinforce recovery. The People's Bank of China lowered the required reserve ratio by 0.5 percentage points, releasing around RMB1 trillion in long-term liquidity, and complemented this with open market operations, medium-term lending facilities, central bank lending programs, and targeted credit tools. Benchmark policy rates were reduced slightly, and structural lending rates were also adjusted lower, contributing to a decline in corporate and mortgage borrowing costs and guiding overall financing costs downward. Policy measures also focused on improving the credit structure through dedicated lending facilities, such as RMB500 billion to support consumption and elderly care and RMB300 billion for sci-tech innovation. By the end of June, aggregate financing to the real economy and broad money supply were growing at 8.9% and 8.3%, respectively, and interest rates on new loans were at historic lows. Despite these improvements, authorities acknowledge that China faces a more challenging external environment marked by weaker global demand, higher trade barriers, and divergence across major economies. (People's Bank of China) </p>
                        <p>Looking ahead, monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative and flexible, with the PBOC aiming to maintain adequate liquidity and align credit growth with broader economic objectives and support a moderate recovery in prices. Policy priorities include improving the interest rate transmission mechanism, lowering banks' funding costs, strengthening the balance between financial support for the real economy and financial stability, and expanding the role of structural policy instruments. The central bank also plans to refine the managed floating exchange rate framework to keep the RMB broadly stable. (People's Bank of China, 2025). </p>
                        <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to maintain a cautious and data-dependent stance through 2025–2026, reflecting a slower-than-anticipated disinflation process and mixed economic conditions across the euro area. The June 2025 policy meeting underscored concerns around persistent wage pressures and elevated services inflation, which continue to slow progress toward the 2% target. Policymakers are also monitoring uneven growth among member states and the risk that premature easing could reverse recent gains in price stability. As a result, the ECB has kept policy rates unchanged and signalled that any easing will depend on clearer evidence of underlying inflation. This meeting-by-meeting approach reflects the bank's preference to avoid forward guidance and instead respond only when the data conclusively support a shift in stance. (CNBC, 2025) </p>
                        <p>The October 2025 Governing Council decision reaffirmed this cautious posture, noting that inflation was edging closer to target, but underlying risks remained, particularly in the context of global trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainty and tight labour markets. The ECB highlighted that financial conditions are restrictive enough to continue dampening demand, and that the recovery remains fragile, especially in sectors exposed to external shocks. Looking ahead, the central bank is expected to keep its three key rates unchanged through most of 2026, with the possibility of gradual cuts. Conversely, upside risks, such as stronger wage settlements or renewed energy price volatility, could delay the start of an easing cycle. Overall, Europe's monetary policy outlook points to cautious patience, with the ECB prioritising durable progress on inflation over early stimulus (European Central Bank, 2025). </p>
                    <h3>Implications</h3>
                        <p>The global monetary policy landscape over 2025–2027 is likely to remain cautious and uneven, with major central banks prioritising sustained progress on underlying inflation before easing financial conditions. The United States and Australia appear positioned for a prolonged period of restrictive settings, reflecting persistent services inflation, strong wage dynamics, and sensitivity to renewed demand pressures. Europe, although further along in its disinflation trajectory, is also expected to move gradually, with policymakers requiring clearer evidence of moderation in wages and core prices before reducing rates. In contrast, China is entering this period with an accommodative stance, using liquidity injections, targeted credit tools, and exchange-rate management to support growth amid external headwinds. Monetary decisions from each market imply that global financial conditions will remain tight overall. For financial markets, this environment suggests that interest-rate movements will remain a key driver of asset prices, and for policymakers, the balance between inflation control and growth stabilisation will continue to define the macroeconomic outlook. </p>
                <h2>Commodities</h2>
                    <h3>Oil</h3>
                        <p>Oil markets over 2025–2027 are likely to see high traded volumes but less ability for producers to force prices sharply higher. On the supply side, capacity is expanding (World Bank, 2025). Projects approved when prices were very high in the early 2020s are now coming online, adding output in OPEC+ countries and in non-OPEC producers such as the United States and Brazil. Together, the system is less constrained than during earlier supply shocks.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>On the demand side, oil consumption is still rising, but not as fast as in the pre-pandemic period. Emerging economies are using more fuel as car ownership and industrial activity increase. However, this is partly offset by more efficient engines, tighter fuel standards, gradual adoption of electric vehicles and slower growth in oil-intensive sectors in advanced economies. As a result, demand growth is positive but moderate (International Energy Agency, 2025).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Because capacity is growing faster than demand, the result is lower average prices and increased traded volumes across the forecast period.</p>
                    <h3>Iron Ore</h3>
                        <p>Iron-ore demand is moving away from dependence on Chinese housing toward a broader mix of infrastructure, defence and energy-transition projects. For most of the last two decades, Chinese residential and commercial construction, plus related urban development, absorbed a very large share of global steel output. That model is now being wound back as policymakers try to reduce financial risks in the property sector and China's rapidly aging population cools demand.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, new sources of steel demand are emerging. Higher defence spending, electricity-grid upgrades, renewable-energy projects and transport infrastructure in advanced economies all require large quantities of steel. India and several economies in South-East Asia are still urbanising and building industrial capacity, which adds structural demand for construction materials and manufactured goods (Goldman Sachs Asset Management, 2025a). These trends mean that, even with weaker Chinese housing activity, global steel demand does not collapse.</p>
                        <p>Most official and private forecasts therefore expect benchmark iron-ore prices to move down from the peaks reached during the height of the Chinese property boom toward a lower range where the largest, lowest-cost producers, such as mines in Australia and Brazil, remain profitable (ING, 2025). New supply from very large projects like Rio Tinto’s Simandou in Guinea, one of the largest untapped iron ore deposits in the world, will add to capacity (S&P, 2025). If this supply ramps up while global demand is flat or falling, as Wood Mackenzie and UBS predict (Harris, 2024), it will reinforce downward pressure on prices.</p>

                    <h3>Agricultural</h3>
                        <p>Agricultural commodities combine steadily rising output with relatively weak long-term price trends. Demand grows with the world population and with income gains in emerging economies, where diets often become more calorie- and protein-intensive. On the supply side, technological progress raises yields through better seeds, improved farming practices, precision use of fertiliser and water, and wider deployment of machinery and digital tools. These changes increase the amount of food produced per hectare and per worker.</p>
                        <p>The joint outlook from the OECD and the Food and Agriculture Organisation projects that global agricultural and fish production will grow faster than world population over the next decade, implying rising output per person (OECD, 2025). Under this baseline, broad indices of crop and food prices are expected to be roughly flat in nominal terms and to fall in real terms compared with the elevated levels seen during recent food and energy shocks. </p>
                        <p>Short-run shocks such as droughts, floods, heatwaves, export bans and conflicts can cause sharp spikes in individual commodity prices and create serious food-security risks. However, when prices rise sharply, farmers usually respond by planting more or investing in productivity-enhancing inputs where they can, and supply eventually catches up. Over a multi-year horizon, the dominant pattern is that global agricultural production and trade volumes increase, while real price indices for broad food baskets trend gently lower in line with a decades-long trend.</p>

                <h2>Foreign Exchange Outlook</h2>
                    <h3>Australian Dollar</h3>
                        <p>The Australian dollar behaves like a leveraged position on Chinese growth and on the global business cycle. China is Australia’s largest export partner, with merchandise trade and services exports of about A$196.0 billion in 2024, mostly in iron ore, coal, gas and other commodities used in construction and energy production (ABS, 2025). When Chinese steel output, construction activity or power demand change, buyers adjust both the quantities purchased and the prices they are willing to pay for these raw materials. Because these exports are priced in global markets and are a large share of Australia’s trade, changes in Chinese industrial data quickly affect commodity prices, Australia’s export income and, through that channel, the Australian dollar.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Most forecasts for 2025–2027 expect China to grow more slowly than in the past but to avoid a hard landing. Projections for 2026 generally lie in the 4–5% range, supported by AI-related investment, electric vehicles and higher-value manufacturing, even as property investment shrinks as a share of GDP (ING, 2025; Vanguard, 2025). In Australia, population growth, public infrastructure and energy-transition projects support activity, while recent inflation and wage outcomes mean the Reserve Bank of Australia is likely to cut interest rates cautiously rather than aggressively. This tends to keep Australian yields relatively attractive compared with some other advanced economies.</p>
                        <p>Given a controlled Chinese slowdown, reasonable domestic fundamentals and slow diversification away from the dollar, the Australian dollar has a medium-term tendency to appreciate.</p>
                    <h3>United States Dollar</h3>
                        <p>The United States dollar enters 2025–2027 after more than a decade of strength. Over this period, it combined relatively high interest rates, strong equity-market performance and a reputation as the safest currency to hold in times of stress. That mix pulled a very large share of global savings into American equities and bonds, and left the USD looking expensive on standard valuation measures, such as purchasing power parity and real effective exchange rates (Goldman Sachs Asset Management, 2025b).</p>
                        <p>Looking ahead, the macro picture is more balanced. Vanguard projects US real GDP growth of about 2.25% in 2026, helped by AI-related investment and sizeable fiscal programs, but also expects core inflation to sit above 2% and policy rates to remain close to an estimated neutral level rather than being cut aggressively (Vanguard, 2025). Tariffs and more interventionist trade policy increase uncertainty about profits and trade flows (RBC, 2025). Recent unusual episodes where United States Treasuries fell alongside equities mean government bonds no longer behave as reliably as a “free hedge” in mixed portfolios (Goldman Sachs, 2025). Moreover, the cost of hedging dollar exposure has also risen. Higher short-term relative interest rates in the United States mean that, when currency risk is hedged using forwards, most or all of the yield advantage of United States bonds is lost for certain foreign investors.</p>
                        <figure class="article-figure">
                            <img src="https://lshtgdpdskhqqxdcwpjo.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/photos/publications/Dec%2017%20Global%20Macro%20Outlook/Cost%20of%20hedging%20a%20US%20dollar%20investment%20as%20a%20percentage%20of%20total%20investment.png" alt="Figure 8: Cost of hedging a US dollar investment as a percentage of total investment" class="article-chart">

                        </figure>
                        <p>The global use of the dollar is also changing gradually. A slightly smaller share of central-bank reserves and international trade is denominated in dollars than a few years ago, and a slightly larger share is in euros, renminbi and other currencies, especially within regional groups such as BRICS. This does not mean the dollar is being replaced or instantaneous “de-dollarisation,” but it does mean that the default view of “dollar for everything” is steadily changing, and foreign investors are increasingly divesting USD-denominated securities.</p>
                        <figure class="article-figure">
                            <img src="https://lshtgdpdskhqqxdcwpjo.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/photos/publications/Dec%2017%20Global%20Macro%20Outlook/S&P%20500%20Drawdown%20for%20US%20investors.png" alt="Figure 9: S&P 500 Drawdown for US investors" class="article-chart">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Taken together, these factors all point to a medium-term profile of moderate USD depreciation against other major currencies.</p>
                    <h3>Euro</h3>
                        <p>The euro has already strengthened meaningfully against the USD. By early May 2025, it had appreciated about 9.8% against the dollar year to date, as investors reassessed US growth prospects, reacted to new US tariffs and diversified away from very large US positions (Goldman Sachs, 2025). This move reflects not only a weaker dollar story but also a shift in expectations about Europe.</p>
                        <p>On the European side, policy has moved away from strict post-crisis austerity. Germany has relaxed its previous budget limits, allowing higher public spending on infrastructure and defence. That change led to upgrades in euro-area growth forecasts and implies a larger future supply of high-quality euro-denominated government bonds. These bonds give global investors a more attractive alternative store of value than in the past. Lower energy prices, compared with the 2022 shock, also improve the position of energy-intensive industries. However, one must also keep in mind the relative illiquidity of European bond markets when compared with the American equivalent.</p>
                        <figure class="article-figure">

                        <p>Provided that euro-area growth does not weaken dramatically and fiscal plans remain credible, the euro is likely to continue appreciating gradually against the dollar, though it will be sensitive to weaker data and to any escalation of tariff or geopolitical risks.</p>
                    <h3>Renminbi</h3>
                        <p>The renminbi is shaped by a range of objectives: supporting growth and the Communist Party’s leadership; maintaining domestic financial stability and national security; and gradually advancing China’s global financial role (Baird et al., 2025). For 2026, many forecasts place Chinese growth between 4% and 5%, supported by AI-related infrastructure, strong exports of electric vehicles and batteries and continued investment in high-value manufacturing, even as property-related investment falls as a share of GDP (Vanguard, 2025;  Morgan Asset Management, 2025). Local government and real estate developer balance sheets remain under strain, which makes sudden exchange-rate moves more dangerous than in more stable systems.</p>
                        <figure class="article-figure">
                            <img src="https://lshtgdpdskhqqxdcwpjo.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/photos/publications/Dec%2017%20Global%20Macro%20Outlook/YoY%20change%20in%20Chinese%20fixed%20asset%20investment%20by%20group.png" alt="Figure 11: YoY change in Chinese fixed asset investment by group" class="article-chart">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Because of these vulnerabilities, the authorities put a high weight on currency stability. A sharp depreciation could trigger capital outflows, raise the local currency cost of foreign debt and undermine confidence in banks and regional governments. A sharp appreciation would hurt exporters at a time when external demand is mixed, and tariffs remain in place in some key markets. To avoid both scenarios, the RMB is managed within a controlled range against a basket of currencies.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, Beijing is trying to increase the RMB’s international use. BRICS’s founding of the New Development Bank in 2015 marks a shift away from Bretton Woods institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, where loans are typically USD-denominated. Bilateral swap lines with other central banks, a dedicated cross-border payment system and a growing number of trade and lending deals settled in RMB, especially within BRICS and with some commodity exporters, all nudge trade away from exclusive dollar use. However, limits on capital mobility and concerns about policy transparency mean most foreign investors still treat RMB assets as a supplement rather than a replacement for dollar assets.</p>
                        <p>This combination of tight management and gradual internationalisation points to a renminbi that stays broadly stable against the dollar over the next few years. A modest appreciation is possible if the dollar weakens and Chinese growth is near the top of forecast ranges.</p>

                        <p>Infrastructure investment has remained resilient despite tighter global financing conditions. Structural requirements in energy transition, housing, transport and digital networks continue to drive capital allocation. According to the World Bank (2025), global infrastructure essentials through 2040 exceed USD 15 trillion, primarily due to ageing assets and climate adaptation demands. These long-term needs underpin investment pipelines across advanced and emerging economies even as interest rates remain relatively high. </p>
                        <p>M&A activity in infrastructure-related industries has softened. Deloitte (2024) reports that global engineering and construction deal volumes fell by approximately 8 per cent in 2024 compared with the previous year, while average deal size declined by 14 per cent. Higher borrowing costs have caused investors to prioritise balance sheet strength and cash flow stability. Even so, infrastructure funds have continued to attract capital. Roland Berger (2025) notes that infrastructure fundraising rebounded in 2024, rising 14 per cent after a sharp decline in 2023, with core and value-add strategies drawing most interest. </p>
                        <p>Energy transition is the most potent catalyst for future infrastructure investment. The International Energy Agency (2024) estimates that annual global clean energy investment needs to exceed USD 4 trillion by 2030 to meet climate objectives. This has motivated utilities and energy companies to pursue acquisitions that secure renewable energy assets, improve grid resilience, and expand electrification capacity.  </p>

                        <p>Additionally, housing supply shortages in economies such as the United States, where the shortfall is estimated at 3.7 million homes (Freddie Mac, 2024), continue to support construction pipelines. These structural forces suggest that infrastructure investment will expand gradually when financing conditions ease.</p>
                    <h3>Emerging-Market Equity Outlook</h3>
                        <p>Emerging-market (EM) equities have strengthened in 2025 after years of weak relative performance. EM indices increased by roughly 10-13 per cent during the early months of 2025, outpacing most developed-market benchmarks (J. P. Morgan Asset Management, 2025). This recovery is supported by improving earnings, a weaker United States dollar, and favourable relative valuations. </p>
                        <p>Growth differentials remain central to the EM investment case. The International Monetary Fund (2025) forecasts EM economic growth of around 4.2 per cent in 2025, compared with approximately 1.5 per cent in advanced economies. Stronger growth expectations have led to improved earnings forecasts. Goldman Sachs (2025) projects EM corporate earnings growth of 10-17 per cent in 2025, with the technology-heavy markets of South Korea and Taiwan benefiting from increased global demand for semiconductors and artificial intelligence-related hardware. </p>
                        <p>Valuations also remain attractive. The MSCI EM index trades at around 12 to 13 times forward earnings, which is close to its multi-decade average and below valuation multiples in major advanced economy markets (J.P. Morgan Asset Management, 2025). Meanwhile, the beginning of monetary policy easing in several EMs and lower hedging costs have encouraged renewed capital inflows. The Institute of International Finance (2025) reports that portfolio inflows strengthened notably at the start of 2025. </p>
                        <figure class="article-figure">
                            <img src="https://lshtgdpdskhqqxdcwpjo.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/photos/publications/Dec%2017%20Global%20Macro%20Outlook/MSCI%20EM%20Index,%20country%20contribution,%20total%20return,%20USD.png" alt="Figure 13: MSCI EM Index, country contribution, total return, USD" class="article-chart">

                        </figure>
                        <p>However, performance across EM countries is uneven. India benefits from strong domestic demand, but high valuations limit further upside. China faces a challenging adjustment in its property sector, while export competitiveness and innovation in electric vehicles and batteries remain strong. Countries that have gained from supply chain diversification, including Vietnam, Mexico and Indonesia, continue to attract foreign direct investment. Overall, the EM equity outlook for 2025 to 2027 is constructive, although sensitive to global financial conditions and geopolitical developments. </p>
                    <h3>United States Treasury Demand Dynamics</h3>
                        <p>In late 2025, US Treasury demand dynamics have shifted markedly from their Q4 2023 state in response to changing market conditions. The 10-year Treasury yield, which reached multi-year highs amid aggressive Fed tightening and record issuance, has since moderated to around 4.1% after the Federal Reserve’s first rate cut in October 2025 (Federal Reserve, 2025a). With the Fed’s balance sheet runoff removing a price-insensitive anchor, the marginal buyer has increasingly become the price-sensitive investor (US Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee [TBAC], 2023). Foreign official holders and US banks are playing a diminished role, with foreign investors now holding roughly one-third of marketable Treasuries, or half of what foreign central banks held (TBAC, 2023). Constrained by regulatory capital limits and interest-rate risk concerns, banks have been cautious about expanding their Treasury portfolios. In turn, domestic funds (mutual funds, pensions, insurers, money market funds) and private foreign investors have absorbed the bulk of new issuance, enticed by higher yields.  </p>
                        <figure class="article-figure">
                            <img src="https://lshtgdpdskhqqxdcwpjo.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/photos/publications/Dec%2017%20Global%20Macro%20Outlook/Private%20Investment%20Absorption.png" alt="Figure 14: Private Investment Absorption" class="article-chart">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Additionally, new sources of structural demand are emerging. Notably, recent legislation now requires dollar stablecoins to be backed largely by short-term Treasuries, potentially adding hundreds of billions in incremental T-bill demand over the coming years (US Department of the Treasury, 2025). Federal Reserve policy and liquidity conditions also remain critical influences. The Fed's quantitative tightening and large fiscal deficits have elevated term premia, but its pivot toward cautious easing, along with ample reserve buffers and facilities like the FIMA repo, have helped maintain orderly market functioning (Federal Reserve 2025b). </p>
                        <p>Finally, emerging pressures underscore investors' focus on US fiscal and geopolitical risks: all major rating agencies have stripped the US of AAA status, and global risk appetite remains tempered by economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions (Moody's Investors Service, 2025). However, US Treasuries continue to attract broad demand as a safe asset, now anchored by a more diverse, yield-sensitive investor base that demands higher compensation to finance America's expanding debt.</p>
                <h2>Geopolitics</h2>
                    <h3>Conflict and Instability: Europe and the Middle East</h3>
                        <p>Geopolitical instability in the Middle East continues to generate volatility across energy markets and trade networks. While most Middle Eastern economies are not at the centre of major tariff disputes, their exposure to global supply chains and strategic realignments makes them sensitive to shifts in international trade flows. For instance, changes in the US-China trade relations can indirectly benefit energy exporters. If Chinese imports of United States liquefied natural gas or agricultural goods decline, China may increase purchases from suppliers such as Qatar or Gulf Cooperation Council members, reinforcing trade ties with the region (International Energy Agency, 2024).</p>
                        <p>Several Middle Eastern and North African countries have also pursued diversified diplomatic and economic partnerships. Nations including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have sought deeper engagement with groupings such as BRICS, reflecting an interest in expanding economic cooperation beyond traditional Western alliances (IMF, 2024). These shifts may gradually influence the currency denomination of energy transactions and encourage greater investment flows linked to Asian infrastructure initiatives, including China's Belt and Road. </p>
                        <p>Sanctions and export controls continue to shape the commercial landscape. Firms based in neutral countries may face secondary sanctions if they engage with entities subject to United States or European Union restrictions, which effectively operate as non-tariff barriers. According to the World Trade Organisation (2025), the global use of targeted sanctions has increased significantly since 2022, amplifying operational and legal risks for exporters, energy traders and transport providers in affected regions. </p>
                    <h3>Tariff and Policy Outlook: Implications for Inflation and Growth</h3>
                        <p>Global tariff policy is expected to remain fluid through 2027. In the United States, trade policy has become increasingly unpredictable. The United States administration has reviewed several tariffs imposed by previous governments and introduced selective reductions, such as lowering tariffs on specific Chinese consumer products in 2025 to ease domestic inflation pressures (Reuters, 2025). However, broad tariff removal remains unlikely due to political incentives to maintain a tough stance on trade. </p>
                        <p>China has responded with its own combination of tariffs and non-tariff barriers, including enhanced regulatory inspections for foreign firms and tightened data requirements (World Bank, 2025). The European Union, while supportive of multilateral frameworks, has adopted a more defensive position. It launched anti-subsidy investigations into Chinese electric vehicle imports in 2023 and has prepared to implement tariffs if such vehicles are found to be unfairly priced (European Commission, 2024). Additionally, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which begins full implementation in 2026, effectively applies a tariff equivalent on imports from countries with lower emissions standards. This policy has raised concerns among developing nations that export carbon-intensive products. </p>
                        <p>Tariff measures can influence inflation dynamics in complex ways. Central banks in smaller open economies, including the Reserve Bank of Australia (2024), note that higher tariffs tend to increase input costs and raise prices for affected goods. However, diverted trade may place downward pressure on some prices if exporters subject to tariffs redirect goods to alternative markets at discounted prices. Research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics (2025) indicates that tariff-driven supply chain duplication and reduced competition typically raise consumer and producer costs over the medium term. </p>
                        <p>The growth implications depend heavily on the trajectory of primary trade relationships. A modest improvement in US-China trade conditions could support global investment and reduce supply chain uncertainty. Conversely, a move towards broad-based 25 per cent tariffs between major economies would significantly weaken global growth prospects. The RBA's (2024) scenario analysis highlights that, while a severe trade conflict is not the baseline case, risks to global activity remain skewed to the downside if protectionist measures expand. </p>
                        <p>Many countries are responding by deepening regional trade integration. Agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), ASEAN frameworks, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) provide tariff-free or reduced-tariff access that offsets some of the adverse effects of global protectionism. However, if strategic divisions between the United States and China and between Russia and Western economies persist, international trade may bifurcate into separate technological and regulatory ecosystems. The IMF (2024) warns that such structural fragmentation would reduce long-term global efficiency and reverse gains associated with decades of globalisation.</p>
                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                        <p>Between 2025 and 2027, geopolitical tensions and tariff dynamics will remain among the most significant global macroeconomic risks. Conflicts and strategic shifts in the Middle East, defensive trade policies in Europe, and unpredictable tariff changes in the United States and China will influence inflation, business confidence and investment flows. Scenario-based analysis will be essential for investors and policymakers. For Australia, continued engagement in regional trade agreements, support for rules-based trade, and an emphasis on Indo-Pacific stability will remain critical for sustaining long-term economic growth. </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The global macroeconomic outlook for 2025 to 2027 reflects both opportunities and vulnerabilities. Long-term structural needs support infrastructure investment, although financing conditions remain tighter than in the previous decade. Emerging markets benefit from favourable growth differentials and cyclical tailwinds, while United States Treasuries continue to attract strong demand despite large fiscal deficits. Climate change represents a critical constraint on African development and requires significantly increased financing. Meanwhile, trade and tariff pressures remain a drag on global economic momentum. The combined effect of these dynamics will shape investment decisions, policy settings and growth outcomes in the coming year. </p>
