            <p class="paragraph">The Social Impact Investment Fund, commonly referred to as SIIF, is the first and only student led investment fund in Victoria managing real capital.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We provide students the opportunity to pitch investment ideas to a team of committee and sponsor representatives, and employ those ideas into a tangible portfolio.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">We direct our principal of $20,000 to achieve high market returns and are committed to distribute 100% of capital gains and dividends to several socially impactful organisations, elected by our members. Over the 2023-24 financial year, SIIF supported partnering charities with $1400 in donations, reflecting our commitment to making a difference.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In addition, we seek to educate, providing real exposure to the world of equities trading and markets. Our frequent weekly macro market updates, workshops and events throughout the year gives students an opportunity for hands on experience.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">SIIF strives to provide professional networking opportunities to advance our members' employability, through network events such as panels, information sessions and social nights. We pride ourselves on producing an environment that encourages discussion, personal development and constructive feedback while maintaining a diverse and welcoming team.</p>
