                            <p>Stock Pitch Night is our premier competitive event where students showcase their analytical skills by presenting investment recommendations to a panel of industry judges. Participants research a company, develop a comprehensive investment thesis, and deliver a compelling presentation arguing why the stock is a buy, sell, or hold. This event simulates the real-world process used by investment analysts and fund managers, providing valuable experience in equity research, financial modeling, and presentation skills. Beyond the competition aspect, Stock Pitch Night creates a collaborative learning environment where participants receive constructive feedback from experienced professionals and peers. Winners receive recognition and sometimes prizes, but all participants gain invaluable experience that stands out on resumes.</p>
